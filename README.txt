DESCRIPTION:

This tool parses content in folders and generates a static html portfolio site.

Some configuration is required. See the makefile and config.php for variables.

Note some functionality might not work because of external library dependencies.
Please file issues in the forum so we can address these as they come up.

Please see the following site to get an example of the possiblities 
http://portfolio.rchrd.net/. More media will be added in the future.

Enjoy!

GETTING STARTED:

cd into the tool directory. Run the following command first:
	> make html 
If that works you should have generated html in example/output, then you can try
to also generate the media with this make command:
	> make 
This will have resized images and copied them over into the output directory. 
This is the most used command.

Later you can try using the sync command to sync this to your server. But first 
make sure to modify the makefile to include the proper url:
	> make sync
