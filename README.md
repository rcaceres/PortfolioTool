Description
===========

Portfolio Tool is a static site generator (think jekyll, hyde, pelican, etc) for porfolios. It simplifies the process of making a portfolio to simply organizing the work in folders and generating the site.

Some configuration is required. See config/example.php for settings. Add more config files to manage more sites.

Note some functionality might not work because of external library dependencies. Please file issues in the forum so we can address these as they come up.

See the following site to get an example of the possiblities 
<http://portfolio.rchrd.net/>. More media will be added in the future.

Enjoy!


Getting Started
===============

If you visit tool.php through your webserver there is a GUI to help get you started.

You can also run tool.php from the command line.

Run the following command to generate the example site. This should generate html in example/output and resize and copy images over into the output directory. 

    php tool.php -c example

Later you can try using the sync command to sync this to your server. Make sure to add your server details to a config.

    php tool.php -c mysite -s
