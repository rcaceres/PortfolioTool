Description
===========

Tool is a static html portfolio site generator (think jekyll, hyde, pelican, etc). 
It simplifies the process of making a portfolio to simply organizing the work in 
folders and generating the site.

Some configuration is required. See config.php for variables.

Note some functionality might not work because of external library dependencies.
Please file issues in the forum so we can address these as they come up.

Please see the following site to get an example of the possiblities 
<http://portfolio.rchrd.net/>. More media will be added in the future.

Enjoy!


Getting Started
===============

If you visit tool.php through your webserver there is a gui to help get you started.

You can also run tool.php from the command line.

cd into the tool directory. Run the following command first:
	> php tool.php -c example
 
If that works you should have generated html in example/output, resized and copied 
images over into the output directory. 

Later you can try using the sync command to sync this to your server. But first 
make sure to modify the makefile to include the proper url:
	> php tool.php -c mysite -s

Add more configurations to config.php
