Dreaming of You is a system for tapping into your computer's dreams. 
<br>>
There are three parts to this program. The first is a screen saver that visualizes 
screenshots that it downloads from a web server. The second is a program that periodically
takes screenshots of your computer and uploads them to the server. The third part is a 
preference widget that displays information about the program and allows you to toggle 
private mode, which temporarily disables taking screenshots.
