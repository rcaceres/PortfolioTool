	<title>Sleep Data</title>
	<body><![CDATA[	
<p>
For almost three years I clocked in and out of sleep using a custom built software tool. This information was publicly available on my website. The homepage would either say "Richard is awake" or "Richard is asleep" and also have an archive of sleep data. I have notoriously been one to oversleep. Collecting this data was simultaneously for self-improvement as well as addressing online privacy concerns and online intimacy possibilities.
