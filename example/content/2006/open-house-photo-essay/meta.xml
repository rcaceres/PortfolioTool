	<title>The Open House â€“ A Bedtime Story</title>
	<body><![CDATA[
This photo essay documents an event that occurred in the Porter Bridge Gallery
at UC Santa Cruz in April 2006. For ten days, the gallery was transformed into
a creative living space. The highlight of this event was a family of five who
lived at the space for the entire duration. The Open House was a project 
produced by Jamie Burkart.
