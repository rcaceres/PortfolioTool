I made this chess set for a class called Form. At the time I was adapting to the switch from studying computer science to studying design. I was used to a problem set oriented education. Design is more open ended. This transition manifested itself as this chess set. The design is based off of early computer punch cards. When viewed from above, the chess set is a grid information. The board is a data structure and the pieces are its elements.

dimensions: 6x6x1 inches
