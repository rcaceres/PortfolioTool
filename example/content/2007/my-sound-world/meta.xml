<p>
The album is a reflection of my changing outlook towards sound and music. It
is about experimenting with and embracing of all sounds. It is about degrees
of composition - some tracks are composed songs, other are recorded sounds,
some contain musical improvisation, some tracks are renditions of songs
composed by other artists, some tracks are played with other musicians,
another track is about learning to play an instrument, and one was created
with loops on a Sega Dreamcast.
</p><p>
Together this is a collection of sounds that I hear and create. Uniquely, 
they form my sound identity or my sound world.
</p><p>
This release is also the fruit of a challenge to create a 45-minute 20-track
album in a few months. It is technically my third album. It's dedicated to
whomever it may concern.
